# Pomodoro's:

1. Setup project & start of refactor readability (comments, dead code, magic string/numbers)
2. Continue readability (renaming, etc)
3. Refactor: Complexity (long method & using mikado technique for Heading enum)
4. Continue refactor: Complexity duplicate code & mikado heading enum
5. Refactor: Reorder responsibilities (data class & message chain are done using mikado) which triggered most of the
   other responsibilities as well.
6. Refactor: Refine abstractions (mostly the data clumps & middle man)
